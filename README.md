# Gauss_formulas  
Using quadrature formulas for rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas, and Gaussian formulas (four-point and five-point), this program calculates integrals of given functions with given accuracy ε.  
  
Using the quadrature formulas of rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas,   
and Gaussian formulas (four-point and five-point),   
this program calculates integrals of given functions with given accuracy ε.   
To achieve accuracy, you need to grind the step h.   
There is also the number of calls to the function and the number of iterations for each quadrature formula.   
The program draws a graph of the integral function.
